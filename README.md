# centos6-lamp
Description:
Script installs Linux-Apache/Nginx-MySQL/PostgreSQL-PHP on remote servers with ssh
1. "centos6-webstack.sh" bash scripts will ask you ip address and root password of remote host
2. This will ask you for database selection (MySql or PostgreSql) and will instal and configure it
3. After DB installation you will be asked to select Webserver between Apache and Nginx
4. Then will come VirtualHost configuration

That's it. Have fun :)
